This repository contains the native design files and source code for the model
and sample disclosure forms the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
designed for its
[final rule regarding Prepaid Accounts](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/final-rules/prepaid-accounts-under-electronic-fund-transfer-act-regulation-e-and-truth-lending-act-regulation-z/)
under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth In Lending
Act (Regulation Z).


## About the prepaid rule

On October 5, 2016, the CFPB finalized strong, federal consumer protections for
prepaid account users. The new rule requires financial institutions to limit
consumers’ losses when funds are stolen or cards are lost, to investigate and
resolve errors, and give consumers free and easy access to account information.

The Bureau’s new rule also includes new “Know Before You Owe” prepaid
disclosures which provide consumers with standard, easy-to-understand, upfront
information about prepaid accounts. Consumers cannot always tell what fees apply
to prepaid accounts before purchasing or signing up for them because the
disclosures may be inside the packaging or hard to find online. This can make it
difficult to comparison shop and make well-informed decisions. The new rule sets
an industry-wide standard on fee disclosures for prepaid accounts. This follows
the tradition of the Bureau’s “Know Before You Owe” disclosure forms for
mortgages and student financial aid awards. These disclosures simplify,
organize, and present information in a way the consumer can easily understand
and act upon. Under the new rule, prepaid consumers will have access to:

- Standard, easy-to-understand, upfront information: The CFPB rule requires two
  forms, one short and one long, with easy-to-understand disclosures. The short
  form concisely and clearly highlights key prepaid account information,
  including the fees the CFPB believes are most important to consumers shopping
  for a prepaid account. These include a periodic fee, per purchase fee, ATM
  withdrawal and balance inquiry fees, cash reload fee, customer service fees,
  and inactivity fee. The short form also must disclose certain information
  about additional types of fees that the consumer may be charged. Consumers
  will also get or be able to access the comprehensive long form disclosure
  containing a complete list of fees and certain other key information before
  acquiring the account.
- Publicly available card agreements: To facilitate comparison shopping, the
  rule requires prepaid account issuers to post on their websites the prepaid
  account agreements they offer to the general public. Additionally, with a few
  exceptions, issuers must submit all agreements to the CFPB, which intends to
  post them on a public, Bureau-maintained website at a future date.  Also,
  issuers must make any agreement not required to be posted on their website
  available to applicable consumers.

## Source files

For the convenience of the prepaid industry and to help reduce development
costs, the Bureau is also providing native design files for print and source
code for web-based disclosures for all of the model and sample forms included in
the final rule.

Native print design files (in EPS and PDF formats) can be found in the
folder structure above, within the `print` folder.
